# Chatbot Project

Welcome to the Chatbot Project! This is a simple chatbot implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. <br>
Explore the live version of the Chatbot on [Kabilan.chat.com](https://kabilankavi131.github.io/ChatBot/).

## Overview

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the chatbot.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the chatbot interface.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file handling the chatbot functionality.
- `botresponses.json`: JSON file containing predefined responses for the chatbot.

## Bot Responses Configuration (botresponses.json)

The `botresponses.json` file contains a list of predefined responses used by the chatbot. You can customize or extend this file to tailor the chatbot's behavior.

Example structure:
```json
{
  "greetings": ["Hello!", "Hi there!", "Greetings!"],
  "farewells": ["Goodbye!", "See you later!", "Farewell!"]
}
```
